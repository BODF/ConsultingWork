This is frankly a code dump to just hold onto a few scripts that I have from my consulting work. There is much more in a private repository. Due to the nature of working for the VA, I cannot always release code that was used in a VA environment (if it shows internal connections/schemas). The files here were used for accessing information external to the VA.

* Ope_ID automation scrapes education facility ID's from a Dept of Education website, for matching with internal VA ID's
* app.R is a Shiny dashboard for an interagency suicide prevention task force. The dashboard was developed in several iterations and the final one uses a Postgre SQL database, hosted by Digital Ocean, to store data in a persistent manner.
